# 2048 Game
## Overview:
This is a console-based implementation of the popular game "2048". The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where the player must slide tiles of numbers up, down, left, or right. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their numbers. The goal of the game is to reach a tile with the number 2048.

## How to Play

1)Download the code and compile it using a C++ compiler.

2)Run the compiled executable file.

3)The game board will appear on the console window.

4)Press w, a, s, or d to move the tiles in the up, left, down, or right direction, respectively.

5)After every move, a new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 will appear on the board.

6)The objective of the game is to merge the tiles with the same values until you reach the number 2048.

7)The game ends when there are no more moves left, either because the board is full or because no tiles can be merged.

## Compiling and Running the Code

To compile the code, simply run the following command in the terminal:

     g++ -o 2048 2048.cpp

This will generate an executable file named 2048. To run the game, simply type:

     ./2048
     
 ## Features planned
 
 1) Score system
